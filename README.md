# Salary Prediction Project 

## Define Problem
The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that can make salary predictions based on given job dispcriptions. With a salary dataset of 1 million job roles along with their associated salaries, I will follow the data science 4D framework of Define, Discover, Develop and Deploy to find the best model with lowest RMSE. I will load, clean and perform some explorary data analysis(EDA) on the data before continuing the modeling process


## Discover Data & Exploration
As previously mentioned, the dataset is a combination of 1 million job roles along with their associated salaries. The salary dataset is broken up into the following three csv files:
- train_feature.csv
- train_salaries.csv
- test_feature.csv
