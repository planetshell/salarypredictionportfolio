I will follow the 4D framework of Define, Discover, Develop and Deploy to accomplish my goal. I will load, clean and perform some explorary data analysis(EDA) on the data before continuing the modeling process. The modeling process will involve This script pulls in salary data, builds and tests several predictive models, and then makes salary predictions on test data using the best model
